- **Hydrogen hub**  
  - Electrolyser (EL)  
  - Hydrogen storage tank (Hâ‚‚ ESS)  
  - Fuel cell (FC)  

- **Thermal and cooling hub**  
  - Heat boiler  
  - Thermal storage (heat buffer)  
  - Air conditioner (AC)  
  - Absorption chiller (AHC)  

- **Supervisory layer**  
  - Learning-Enhanced Stochastic Model Predictive Control (LE-SMPC)  
  - Trustworthy Machine Learning forecasting  
  - Digital Twin for system monitoring and resilience
